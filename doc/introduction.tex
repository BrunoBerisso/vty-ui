\chapter{Introduction}

The terminal emulator user interface is a good, lightweight
alternative to fully graphical interfaces such as those provided by
GTK, QT, and the Windows and Macintosh OS X operating systems.  Aside
from being lightweight, such interfaces are appealing because they can
be used for remote administration more easily, and many users prefer
them over graphical interfaces for their responsiveness.

Historically, terminal interfaces have been notoriously difficult to
program.  Libraries have appeared to aid in this task, such as
Ncurses.  Ncurses is fairly low-level so other, higher-level libraries
arose, such as CDK, Dialog, and Newt.

\vtyui\ provides a “widget” infrastructure for constructing user
interfaces similar to what you will find in libraries such as QT and
GTK.  In addition to rendering infrastructure, \vtyui\ provides
infrastructure for managing user input events, changes in widget
focus, box layout support, and a flexible API for binding event
handlers to widget events.  It is built on the Vty library, which
provides functionality similar to Ncurses.
