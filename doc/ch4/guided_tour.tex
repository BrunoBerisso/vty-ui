\chapter{Guided Tour of Built-In \vtyui\ Widgets}

\vtyui\ provides a broad set of widgets for controlling layout,
presenting text, and interacting with the user.  In this chapter we'll
cover these built-in widgets and their APIs at a high level.  With
this knowledge you should be able to bring them together to build rich
interfaces.  As always, consult the API documentation for some of the
finer details.
