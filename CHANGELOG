1.0 -> 1.0.1
------------

Bug fixes:

  List:
    * removeFromList now recomputes scrolling window info correctly.
    * removeFromList fixes new selected index when pos > sel.
    * clearList now sets the selectedIndex correctly.

  Core:
    * mergeFocusGroups now correctly preserves existing handlers and
      establishes new FocusGroup manipulation handlers.
    * resetFocusGroup now uses the right index range (was resetting
      the focused element to zero, now -1)
