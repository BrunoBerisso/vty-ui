1.0.1 -> 1.1
------------

API changes:
  * Interface change: List: newList no longer takes a widget
    constructor; addToList and friends take the widget instead
  * Interface change: stop using MonadIO, use IO instead.  The real
    issue here was that the library was failing to make good on an
    attempted promise of sequencing vty-ui actions with an arbitrary
    IO-based monad transformer stack, in particular because event
    handlers could not be sequenced in the same MonadIO instance as
    everything else.

API additions:
  * Add shutdownUi signal to stop event loop (fixes issue #3)
  * List: add setSelected and getListItem functions
  * List: add insertIntoList for arbitrary insertion

Internal changes:
  * Box: query child widgets for cursor position info
  * List: use at least a one-row-high item height to support emtpy list
    items (e.g., empty text widgets)
  * List: removeFromList: when the list is focused, manage focus state
    of widgets involved
  * List: forward key events to currently-selected item; also focus and
    unfocus items as selection changes
  * Edit: move {remove,inject} to Util
  * FormattedText: do not provide cursor positioning info.

Misc:
  * Util.mergeAttr: Vty uses bitwise OR to merge styles, but that means
    we cannot turn style bits off, so we just replace the style mask
    entirely
  * cabal file: loosen library dependencies a bit.
  * ListDemo: focus the edit widget initially.

1.0 -> 1.0.1
------------

Bug fixes:

  List:
    * removeFromList now recomputes scrolling window info correctly.
    * removeFromList fixes new selected index when pos > sel.
    * clearList now sets the selectedIndex correctly.

  Core:
    * mergeFocusGroups now correctly preserves existing handlers and
      establishes new FocusGroup manipulation handlers.
    * resetFocusGroup now uses the right index range (was resetting
      the focused element to zero, now -1)
