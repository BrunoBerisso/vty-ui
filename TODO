- Haddock

- WrappedText widget? (Just plain vty "string" truncates at the
  terminal boundary!)

- List: implement a "resizeWindow" function which will adjust the
  visible window size; one might want to size a list widget's visible
  window as a function of terminal height.  This should automatically
  change what is selected if the window size gets smaller than the
  currently selected index.

- Is VBox growthPolicy sane for all content configurations?
