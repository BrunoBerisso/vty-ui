- List: implement a "resizeWindow" function which will adjust the
  visible window size; one might want to size a list widget's visible
  window as a function of terminal height.  This should automatically
  change what is selected if the window size gets smaller than the
  currently selected index.

- Is VBox growthPolicy sane for all content configurations?

- Is the current GrowthPolicy type sufficient?

- Add functions to get access to information about specific widgets
  (attributes, height settings, etc.) so they aren't totally opaque

- Box layout widget documentation so it's clear from the docs how
  widgets get laid out

- Widgets:

  - Scrollable area (a generalization of the List) which can wrap a
    widget and make it scrollable in a confined space.  To make this
    work, we may need masking support in Vty.  Scrolling is really
    just (top, left, widget, mask window size) where the window size
    depends on available space and top/left positions are modified by
    the application as scrolling requests are received.
