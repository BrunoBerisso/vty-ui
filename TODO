- Rewriting tasks:

  - Resize event handler support.  Top-level or per-widget?  Maybe not
    even necessary?

  - Layering (i.e., dialogs), probably needs research into transposed
    images in Vty (which are not implemented yet).  Once dialogs work,
    we could make them fancy and modal by rendering the underlying UI
    in black and white and the dialog in color!

  - Ability to clear (reset) key event handler on a widget

  - Support for "showing" and "hiding" widgets

  - Generalize borders by adding "spacing" widgets that add a number
    of rows or columns of space on a given side of a widget.  This is
    already basically possible with vBorderWith ' ' and hBorderWith '
    ', but it would also be nice to make these explicit and add a
    "bordered"-style box spacing wrapping widget type.

  - Use vty-ui exceptions to report errors instead of calling error

  - Scrollable area (a generalization of the List) which can wrap a
    widget and make it scrollable in a confined space.  To make this
    work, we may need masking support in Vty.  Scrolling is really
    just (top, left, widget, mask window size) where the window size
    depends on available space and top/left positions are modified by
    the application as scrolling requests are received.

  - List: do audit for calculations that should be done in terms of
    itemHeight

  - support for right-aligning text (just left-padding?)

  - Radio button widgets

    newRadio :: (MonadIO m) => String -> Char -> m (Widget Radio)
    (label, char used to indicate checked)
    newRadioGroup :: ...

    Need to think about how to make it impossible to avoid putting all
    radio buttons in a group into the same focus group; in a way we
    don't want to care about which specific things are in the group;
    we just want to say "link this focus group with that radio group."

  - Checkbox widgets (same as radio, just not linked)

- Testing:

  - Ugh.  Need loads of tests for tricky things.
