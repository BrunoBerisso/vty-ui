- List: implement a "resizeWindow" function which will adjust the
  visible window size; one might want to size a list widget's visible
  window as a function of terminal height.  This should automatically
  change what is selected if the window size gets smaller than the
  currently selected index.

- Is VBox growthPolicy sane for all content configurations?

- Add functions to get access to information about specific widgets
  (attributes, height settings, etc.) so they aren't totally opaque

  widgets get laid out

- Widgets:

  - Scrollable area (a generalization of the List) which can wrap a
    widget and make it scrollable in a confined space
