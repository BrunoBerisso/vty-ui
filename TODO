- Rewriting tasks:

  - Resize event handler support.  Top-level or per-widget?  Maybe not
    even necessary?

  - Layering (i.e., dialogs), probably needs research into transposed
    images in Vty (which are not implemented yet).  Once dialogs work,
    we could make them fancy and modal by rendering the underlying UI
    in black and white and the dialog in color!

  - Ability to clear (reset) key event handler on a widget

  - Lists: add handlers for adding and removing elements, like

    list `onItemAdded` \this (idx, w) -> ...
    list `onItemRemoved` \this (idx, w) -> ...

  - Lists: function for setting the currently-selected element by
    index?

  - Lists: sort out list normal attributes vs. widget attributes;
    which one takes precedence?  If the list, then we can construct
    item widgets with the default attribute and always override at
    render time with either the normal or selected attributes (or the
    global override attribute, mAttr)

  - Consider removing (Widget a) from signature of event handlers;
    while for some this could be ugly (and in some cases having that
    could be really useful), in most cases it'll probably be
    unnecessary noise (binding a second name to something already in
    closure scope)

  - Support for "showing" and "hiding" widgets

  - Generalize borders by adding "spacing" widgets that add a number
    of rows or columns of space on a given side of a widget.  This is
    already basically possible with vBorderWith ' ' and hBorderWith '
    ', but it would also be nice to make these explicit and add a
    "bordered"-style box spacing wrapping widget type.

  - Focus groups: rethink initialization interface (it's annoying that
    it takes a required element, but it's safe).  The API is weird.

  - Use vty-ui exceptions to report errors instead of calling error

  - Scrollable area (a generalization of the List) which can wrap a
    widget and make it scrollable in a confined space.  To make this
    work, we may need masking support in Vty.  Scrolling is really
    just (top, left, widget, mask window size) where the window size
    depends on available space and top/left positions are modified by
    the application as scrolling requests are received.

  - table widget for laying out name/value pairs in nice format

  - support for right-aligning text (just left-padding?)

- Testing:

  - Ugh.  Need loads of tests for tricky things.
